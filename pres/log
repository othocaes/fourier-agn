Week 1:

Given four papers to read
Giving version 1 of the psdlag program
spent some time exploring the program
mostly read papers


Week 2:
Given calibration data in the form of light curves produced by a known transfer function

Did things, forgot to keep track

Week 3-4ish:
A script has been created to read an output file from psdlag and then plot the source and reprocessed power spectral densities, the cross-correlation power spectral density, and the phase difference between the signals.

2016-


2016-07-11

	created gnuplot templates for plotting the timelags and power spectrum densities
		- still need to modify this for points to be evenly spaced in log space

2016-07-14
	Ran through results with simple error checking and determined they made sense.
	Project can continue.

2016-07-15
	Determined frequency binning for PSD and timelags:

	Ran first MCMC run, need to analyze results
