Week 1:

Given four papers to read
Giving version 1 of the psdlag program
spent some time exploring the program
mostly read papers


Week 2:
Given calibration data in the form of light curves produced by a known transfer function

Did things, forgot to keep track


A script has been created to read an output file from psdlag and then plot the source and reprocessed power spectral densities, the cross-correlation power spectral density, and the phase difference between the signals.
