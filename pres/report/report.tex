\section{Introduction}

The study of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) promises to inform many fields of physical science. As a standard candle, AGN could provide structural information about the universe beyond the supernova horizon, allowing a better measurement of cosmological parameters such as the Expansion Coefficient.
