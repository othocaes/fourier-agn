Hi Otho,

This is getting there, but, still a few things to do.  I’ll give you just some general comments, and leave most of the nit-picky phrasing of words for after these are done.

✓ You need to think about the audience - most of the people who will read this will either be Wayne State Physics professors (who know little about astronomy) or potential REU students who are looking at the website, and probably know little about astronomy.  So, your introduction needs to be broader, bigger picture stuff (why do we even care about AGN in the first place?!).  I think you need at least one paragraph at the beginning that explains what an AGN is, and the evidence for accretion onto a supermassive black hole (use one of your Intro astronomy textbooks as a guide there), and why we should care about this.  This will setup the rest of the report for the non-AGN astronomer.

* Accretion disk reverberation needs describing in more detail.  How are the lags expected change with wavelength? [see equations in Collier et al. 1999: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999MNRAS.302L..24C, Cackett et al. 2007, or Fausnaugh et al 2016]. Giving the equations will help.  More clearly explain why the UV part of the disk has a shorter lag than the cooler, optical part of the disk - you have Figure 1 there, refer to it!  You can then refer back to these equations and expectations when discussing the results - are the wavelength dependent lags we see consistent with this picture?

* Every figure needs to be cited in the text. Figure 10 and 11 are repeats of Figures earlier in the report - just reference the earlier figure number.

* FIgure 2 and 3 deserved to be described in more detail in section 2.2.  Why do the lags look like they do? How does the size of the top-hat function correspond to the lags and the frequency at which the lags start to oscillate?  Why do the lags oscillate?  I think writing these things down will really help your understanding of this.  (Hint: all the answers are in Uttley et al. 2014).

✓ We always write 'emission' rather than 'emissions'

✓  convoluted -> convolved

Once you’ve done these, send me along the revised version for hopefully the last set of comments…..
