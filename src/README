To compile, modify the file makefile to so that libdir and incdir point to where
alglib library and header files are installed respectively, then run: make


FILES:
- README: this file
- makefile: a make file for compiling
- main.cpp: the main file, that process the input file, print help message if
  needed and reads the light curves files. check readLC to see the light curve
  format.
- mod.cpp: contains the class mod, which is a base class that uses the likelihood method. This on its own does nothing, but it is meant to be inherited by others, e.g. psd , lag , lag10
  etc ... It is here where the likelihood is calculated, and maximized.

- psd.cpp: a child class of mod to calculate psds. psd10 is similar by it
  calculate the log10 of psd. This is better than calculating the psd directly.

- lag.cpp: a child class of mod to calculate cross spectra and phase lags.
  similar to psd. there is also lag10 that calcualte the log10 of the cross
  spectrum plus phase lag.

- psdlag.cpp: a child class of mod to calculate psd and cross spec and phase
  lag at the same time.

- inc: contains the header files.

- inc/mod.hpp: the header for mod.cpp. This file has the Mod class also, which
  is a class that holds multiple mod's used for fitting multiple light curve
  simultaneusly, each mod fits for one light curve, and the total log-likelihood
  is the sum of individual likelihood (i.e. product of probabilities)
